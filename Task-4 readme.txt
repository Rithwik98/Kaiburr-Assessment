In this code, we're using React's state hook to manage the list of users and the new user input. We're also using the useEffect hook to fetch the list of users from the server when the component mounts.

We're using axios to make HTTP requests to the server API endpoints for creating, reading, and deleting users.

The UI consists of a list of users, a form for creating new users, and a delete button for each user.

To run this code, we need to set up a server API that implements the following endpoints:

GET /api/users - Returns a list of users
POST /api/users - Creates a new user
DELETE /api/users/:id - Deletes a user with the given ID
You can use any server-side technology to implement these endpoints, such as Node.js and Express.

Once set the server API running, we can run the React app using npm start and see the UI in your web browser.
